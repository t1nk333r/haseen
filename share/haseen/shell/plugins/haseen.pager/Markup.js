// Reading what senders actually put in a notification.
//
// The spec allows a small HTML subset in the body. Senders use it for things
// the spec did not intend - Chrome glues a link to its own origin onto the
// front of every message, which renders as a blue "app.slack.com" above text
// you actually care about. So this does two jobs: work out where a
// notification really came from, and render only what is safe to render.

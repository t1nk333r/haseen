	// Chromatic weighting: pixels with OKLCH chroma above ChromaBoostThreshold get

	// muted backgrounds. The boost is graded by chroma rather than a flat factor: a
	// barely-chromatic pixel gets one extra copy (matching the old flat 2x), while the
	// most vivid pixels get up to ChromaBoostMaxExtra copies. The ramp is linear in
	// chroma over ChromaBoostRampChroma above the threshold. Grading (vs the old hard
	// 2x cliff at the threshold) lets a small saturated highlight earn proportionally

	// lightness extremity. 0 reproduces the old "single most-extreme color" behavior;

	// vivid speck (a logo, a distant neon sign): the chroma-boost duplicates those
	// specks enough to fool an unweighted count into seeing a colorful, multi-hue
	// image, but by true coverage the frame is monochrome and should get a cohesive
	// single-family palette rather than vivid accents pulled from a 1% region.

	// Kept low (6%) so only genuinely color-starved images fall here: an image with

	// edge. Smaller arc = more unified/monochromatic; larger = more in-family
	// variety.

	//     mono image with a little real hue variety still fans its accents out
	//     across the family, but never far enough to leave it.
	//   - ExplicitMonoArcDeg: the user-selected `monochromatic` mode. Tighter, so
